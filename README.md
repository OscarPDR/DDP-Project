# DDP-Project
Project for the Developing Data Products coursera course

This web application was developed for coursera's "Developing Data Products" course, offered by Johns Hopkins University as part of the "Data Science" specialization.

The application's demo can be viewed in [shinyapps.io](https://oscarpdr.shinyapps.io/DDP-Project/), and the source code is available under this repository.

The used dataset is provided within the **ggplot2** package, and contains data about nearly 54k diamonds.

The carried out analysis is quite simple, in order to get a general understanding of the contents of the dataset using the  technologies learned during the course.
