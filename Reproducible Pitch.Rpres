ggplot2's diamonds dataset
========================================================

The nearly 54k observations are defined by:

- Price: in US dollars
- Carat: weight of the diamond
- Cut: quality of the cut
- Color: diamond color
- Clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is
- X: length in mm
- Y: width in mm
- Z: depth in mm
- Depth: total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y)
- Table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point

The dataset looks as follows
========================================================

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
summary(diamonds)
```

Data table view
========================================================

This tab panel allows to filter the rows present in the dataset according to three variables:

- Carat
- Cut
- Color

Only those rows matching the selection will be rendered

Price chart view
========================================================

Finally, the last tab panel plots a chart, in which the Y-axis will always be the **price** variable.

The user can select any other variable for the X-axis, and the chart will react to the user's input in little time.
